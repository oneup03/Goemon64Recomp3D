# Building Guide

This guide will help you build the project on your local machine. The process will require you to provide a decompressed ROM of the US version of the game.

These steps cover: decompressing the ROM, running the recompiler and finally building the project.

## 1. Clone the Goemon64Recomp Repository
This project makes use of submodules so you will need to clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules
# if you forgot to clone with --recurse-submodules
# cd /path/to/cloned/repo && git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

### Linux
For Linux the instructions for Ubuntu are provided, but you can find the equivalent packages for your preferred distro.

```bash
# For Ubuntu, simply run:
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev lld llvm clang
```

### Windows
You will need to install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
In the setup process you'll need to select the following options and tools for installation:
- Desktop development with C++
- C++ Clang Compiler for Windows
- C++ CMake tools for Windows

The other tool necessary will be `make` which can be installe via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):
```bash
choco install make
```

## 3. Decompressing the target ROM
You will need to decompress the NTSC-U Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon ROM (sha1: df8083a54296b8c151917c5333e1c85f014a2a66) before running the recompiler.

Follow the build instructions for the [Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon Decompilation Project](https://github.com/klorfmorf/mnsg) in order to generate a decompressed ROM.

Copy the decompressed ROM with the name `baserom.us.decompressed.z64` from the root of the decompilation project to the root of the Goemon64Recomp repository and rename it to `mnsg.us.decompressed.z64`.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure the *decompressed* ROM (32 MB) is the one named `mnsg.us.decompressed.z64`. The original *compressed* ROM (16 MB) — if you also keep it around — must NOT be named `mnsg.z64`, because Windows would case-insensitively shadow the decompressed file referenced in `mnsg.toml` and cause N64Recomp to "recompile" compressed data as MIPS, producing thousands of bogus errors. The expected SHA1 of the original is `df8083a54296b8c151917c5333e1c85f014a2a66`; the decompressed file will have a different hash.

## 4. Generating the C code

Now that you have the required files, you must build [N64Recomp](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp) and run it to generate the C code to be compiled. The building instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp?tab=readme-ov-file#building). That will build the executables: `N64Recomp` and `RSPRecomp` which you should copy to the root of the Goemon64Recomp repository.

After that, go back to the repository root, and run the following commands:
```bash
./N64Recomp mnsg.us.toml
./RSPRecomp aspMain.us.toml
```

## 5. Building the Project

Finally, you can build the project! :rocket:

On Windows, you can open the repository folder with Visual Studio, and you'll be able to `[build / run / debug]` the project from there.

If you prefer the command line or you're on a Unix platform you can build the project using CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # or Debug if you want to debug
cmake --build build-cmake --target Goemon64Recompiled -j$(nproc) --config Release # or Debug
```

## 6. Success

Voilà! You should now have a `Goemon64Recompiled` executable in the build directory! If you used Visual Studio this will be `out/build/x64-[Configuration]` and if you used the provided CMake commands then this will be `build-cmake`. You will need to run the executable out of the root folder of this project or copy the assets folder to the build folder to run it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In the game itself, you should be using a standard ROM, not the decompressed one.
